This code show a rotating torus changing color. 

To do so, I used codes from the p5js.org references, and modified it. I firstly used the torus function from the 3d primitives, and changed the settings to create this shape. Then, I made some simple if statements to change its color progressively. I lastly tried the different methods to color 3D shapes,  with the fill function and the various Material functions. I chose to finially use the emissiveMaterial function, where the object will show its color independantly from the light source used, and then added a  point light linked to the mouse potition.


The functions used were pretty straight forward and to me were similar to writing text. Every information comes in logical order, and the various functions are self explenatory.

To me, this coding experience went both ways : I had an idea of what I wanted to create, and the available functions helped change / define that idea.
